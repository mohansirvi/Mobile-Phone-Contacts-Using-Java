# Mobile-Phone-Contacts-Using-Java
 Implements a simple mobile phone with the following capabilities:
 1. Able to store, modify, remove and query contact names.
 2. Separate class for Contacts (name and phone number).
 3. A master class (MobilePhone) that holds the ArrayList of Contacts.
 4. Options:  Quit, print list of contacts, add new contact, update existing contact, remove contact and search/find contact.
 5. When adding or updating be sure to check if the contact already exists (use name).
 6. Be sure not to expose the inner workings of the Arraylist to MobilePhone.
 7. MobilePhone should do everything with contact only.
